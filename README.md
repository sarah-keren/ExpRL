# RLPE
Implementation of RLPE model. 

We suggest using formal MDP abstractions and transforms, previously used in the literature for expediting the search for optimal policies, to automatically produce explanations. Since such transforms are typically based on a symbolic representation of the environment, they may represent meaningful explanations for gaps between the anticipated and actual agent behavior. We formally define this problem, suggest a class of transforms that can be used for explaining emergent behaviors, and suggest methods that enable efficient search for an explanation.
